                            <p>It was the cultures of the great river valleys—including the Nile, the Tigris and
                                Euphrates, the Indus, and the Huang Ho—with their intensive agriculture based on
                                irrigation—that developed the first communities large enough to be called
                                cities. These cities were built with a new building technology, based on the
                                clay available on the riverbanks. The packed clay walls of earlier times were
                                replaced by those constructed of prefabricated units: mud bricks. This
                                represented a major conceptual change from the free forms of packed clay to the
                                geometric modulation imposed by the rectangular brick, and the building plans
                                too became strictly rectangular.</p>
